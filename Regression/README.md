# 🧮 Regression Models in Machine Learning

This repository presents a collection of **regression algorithms** implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**.  
Each subfolder demonstrates a different approach to predicting continuous values, from simple linear models to advanced ensemble methods.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `SimpleLinearRegression/` | Implements a basic linear regression with one feature. |
| `MultipleLinearRegression/` | Extends linear regression to multiple features (multivariate). |
| `PolynomialLinearRegression/` | Uses polynomial transformations to capture non-linear relationships. |
| `SVR/` | Support Vector Regression implemented with scikit-learn. |
| `DecisionTreeRegression/` | Regression using decision tree algorithms. |
| `RandomForestRegression/` | Ensemble regression model combining multiple decision trees. |
